# Homework 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Task

The purpose of this project was to build a portfolio page with deployed work samples. 

You will find the portfolio under construction, but still meeting the criteria of the assignment as a working page. 

* WHEN you load their portfolio
* THEN you are presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN you click one of the links in the navigation
* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN you click on the link to the section about their work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN you are presented with the developer's first application
* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN you click on the images of the applications
* THEN you are taken to that deployed application
* WHEN you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
